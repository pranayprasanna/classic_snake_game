# classic_snake_game
Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in 1976, and became popular when it was made available on several Nokia mobile phones.

The aim of this project was to replicate the ‘Snake’ game using Windows Forms on Microsoft’s Visual Studio.

This edition of Snake is more special than the earlier versions for a few reasons.

1.	It offers 3 different game speeds: 
       i)	Slow (For Beginners)	
       ii)	Medium (For Amateurs)	
       iii)	Fast (For Experts)

2.	It offers 3 different game themes: 
       i) Desert Snake	
       ii) Jungle Snake	
       iii)	Water Snake

3.	It features a ‘Snap’ button, which can be used to take a screenshot and share your performance in the game with family and friends.
